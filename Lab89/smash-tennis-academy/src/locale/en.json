    "about": "Our Tennis & School programme offers our young students high-level academic and sports tuition, allowing them to combine year-round intensive training and tournaments with an adapted school curriculum. We need to evaluate every applicant on both their tennis and education levels but also on their motivation and mindset to make sure they are ready to join the Smash! Academy Team. During the 2019 Spring Nationals in Surprise, AZ, we placed 4th out of 64 teams in the nation! In Fall 2017, we placed 2nd in our Eastern Sectionals tournament, earning a bid to Nationals in the Spring of 2018. We practice three nights a week at Reis Tennis Center. In addition to playing tennis, we are active in our community and participate in service events such as ACEing Autism and Ithaca's Into the Streets. Our goal as a club is to provide a way for students to compete at a high level while emphasizing the fun in tennis."
